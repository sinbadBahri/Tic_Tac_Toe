Welcome to Tic_Tac_Toe
===========

This is a single player Tic_Tac_Toe game, written in Python.

It's only a mini project so I did certainly not put time for the graphic design.

Make sure to choose the right move or you might loose :)

**Requirements**

* python 3.11
* termcolor 2.3

## How to run

First make sure that you have [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Install "termcolor" module:

    pip install termcolor

Then open "setup.py" and start the game.

### Looking forward for your opponion

If you have any suggestions please share it with me.

Und korriegieren Sie mich wenn ich mich irre :)
Dankesch√∂n
